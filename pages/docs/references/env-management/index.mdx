# ENV Management

Welcome to the guide on managing environment variables with the bolt-framework!

This document will walk you through the `env:generate` command and its usage within a project that consists of multiple microservices.

By using this command, you can generate `.env` files from `.env.tpl` (environment template) files, allowing you to manage environment variables in a structured manner.

## Introduction

The `env:generate` command is a powerful tool that helps you manage environment variables in a project with multiple microservices.

It enables you to generate `.env` files based on the content of `.env.tpl` files found in each microservice directory.

Additionally, it facilitates exporting microservice-specific variables to the root, making it easy to reference these variables among different microservices.

## Understanding Project Structure

Before we delve into the `env:generate` command, let's understand the project structure it supports.

In this setup —

- Your project has a root directory representing the entire project, containing several microservice directories
- Each microservice directory has its own `.env.tpl` file, defining environment variables specific to that microservice
- The root directory also contains a `.env.tpl` file for project-wide variables applicable to the entire project

Here's how the project structure looks —

```bash
project-a/
  .env.tpl (project-wide variables)
  service-a/
    .env.tpl (variables specific to service-a)
  service-b/
    .env.tpl (variables specific to service-b)
```

## The env:generate command

The `env:generate` command scans your project's structure, utilizing `bolt.yaml` files and linked services from `bolt.service.yaml` files' `envfile` variable.

It identifies the `.env.tpl` files within each microservice directory and generates corresponding `.env` files for them.

Additionally, it exports microservice-specific variables to the root, enabling easy referencing among microservices.

### Generating .env files

When you run the `env:generate` command, it performs the following actions:

1. Scans the project structure using `bolt.yaml` and linked services from each service's `bolt.service.yaml` file
2. Looks for `.env.tpl` files within each microservice directory
3. Generates a `.env` file for each `.env.tpl` file found, located in the same directory
4. Populates the generated `.env` files with variables and their respective values from the corresponding `.env.tpl` files

### Microservice Variable Export

The `env:generate` command exports microservice-specific variables to the root, making it easy to reference these variables among different microservices. The exported variables follow this format — `%<service_name_without_special_chars>_<variable_name>%`

For example, if you have a variable named `MY_VAR` in `service-a`, it would be exported as `SERVICEA_MY_VAR` in the root. This allows other microservices to reference `SERVICEA_MY_VAR` to access the value of `my_var` from `service-a`.

### Root .env.tpl File

The root directory's `.env.tpl` file contains project-wide variables applicable to the entire project.

> Important Note: Variables defined in this file are not prefixed with a service name since they are not specific to any particular microservice.

## Usage Example

Let's illustrate the usage of the `env:generate` command and variable referencing through an example:

Assume the following variables are defined in the respective `.env.tpl` files:

```env
# File location: project-a/.env.tpl
PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-a/.env.tpl
APP_KEY="SERIVICE A KEY"
APP_PORT=9001
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-b/.env.tpl
APP_KEY="SERVICE B KEY"
APP_PORT=9002
```

After executing the `env:generate` command, the following files will be generated:

```env
# File location: project-a/.env
PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
LOG_LEVEL=debug
SERVICEA_APP_KEY="SERVICE A KEY"
SERVICEA_APP_PORT=9001
SERVICEB_APP_KEY="SERVICE B KEY"
SERVICEB_APP_PORT=9002
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-a/.env
APP_KEY="SERIVICE A KEY"
APP_PORT=9001
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-b/.env
APP_KEY="SERVICE B KEY"
APP_PORT=9002
```

### Using env variables across Microservices

Each microservice can reference the variables using the `%<service_name>_<variable_name>%` syntax. For instance, in `service-a`, you can use `%SERVICEB_APP_PORT%` to access the value of `APP_PORT` defined in `service-b`.

Let's consider a scenario where `SERVICEA` is an API Service, and `SERVICEB` is a Client App. We want to construct the API's base URL in the client app's env file.

```env
# File location: project-a/.env.tpl
PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-a/.env.tpl
APP_NAME="API Service"
APP_PORT=9001
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-b/.env.tpl
APP_NAME="Client App"
APP_PORT=9002
API_URL="http://localhost:%SERVICEA_APP_PORT%"
```

After executing the `env:generate` command, the following files will be generated:

```env
# File location: project-a/.env
PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
LOG_LEVEL=debug
SERVICEA_APP_NAME="API Service"
SERVICEA_APP_PORT=9001
SERVICEB_APP_NAME="Client App"
SERVICEB_APP_PORT=9002
SERVICEB_API_URL="http://localhost:9001"
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-a/.env
APP_NAME="API Service"
APP_PORT=9001
```

```env
# File location: project-a/service-b/.env
APP_NAME="Client App"
APP_PORT=9002
API_URL="http://localhost:9001"
```

Now you have a clear understanding of how to use the `env:generate` command and manage environment variables across your microservices using bolt-framework.

We have put down a tutorial to help you get started and give you a basic example of how env management really works and how to use it in a project containing two services (ie. NextJS apps) using Bolt!
