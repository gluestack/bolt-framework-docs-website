# Defining Bolt Ignore file

Bolt uses a `.boltignore` file to determine which files and directories to ignore when packaging your project into bolt's virtual machine. This file is similar to `.gitignore` file.

This file should be kept in the root of your project directory and should be committed to your version control system.

`.boltignore` file comes with `bolt init` command. It is already prefilled with the following content to get you started -

```bash
node_modules
.logs
.git
vendor
```
