# Defining Bolt file

Bolt CLI manages your projects and its services using two types of yaml files. One is of them is **bolt.yaml**. Here’s how **bolt.yaml** work and manages processes for you.

This file contains your project information, envfile’s path, default service runner for your project, bolt services list, ingress routing to your bolt services & project runner server’s configuration.
You can generate this file using init & service:add commands. Below’s the base template for **bolt.yaml** file.

```yaml
envfile: <path/to/envfile>
project_id: '<Project ID>'
project_name: <Project Name>
services: null
ingress: null
```

Here's how **bolt.yaml** file would look after running the init command —

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687504622045'
project_name: mynextapp
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Definition

### envfile

This is the path to your project's envfile. Bolt CLI uses this file to load environment variables for your project. You can use `.env.tpl` as your envfile. Bolt CLI will automatically generate `.env` file from `.env.tpl` file.

### project_id

This is the unique ID for your project. Bolt CLI uses this ID to identify your project. You can use `bolt project:list` command to list all your projects.

### project_name

This is the name of your project. Bolt CLI uses this name to identify your project. You can use `bolt project:list` command to list all your projects.

### services

This is the list of services for your project. You can add services to your project using `bolt service:add` command. You can also add services manually to this list.

To add services manually to this list, you need to map service's path in `bolt.yaml` file and add service's configuration in [bolt-service.yaml](/docs/references/bolt.service.yaml) file.

```yaml
services:
  <service-container-name>:
    path: <path/to/bolt.service.yaml>
```

We will learn more on configuration of services in [bolt-service.yaml](/docs/references/bolt.service.yaml) section.

### ingress

This is the list of servers & their locations for your project. You can add ingress servers & routes manually to this list.

We will learn more on configuration of ingress routes in [ingress](/docs/references/ingress) section.
