## Objectives

Here we have created a project where we have one service called `service-one` which is a simple http server made using `express` and `nodejs`.

Our Main objectives are:

- Run this project using bolt in local machine.
- Run this project using bolt in docker.

## Project Structure

The project structure of our app is as follows:

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
simple-http-server/
╰─➤ service-one/
  ╰─➤ bolt.service.yaml
  ╰─➤ build.Dockerfile
  ╰─➤ index.js
  ╰─➤ package.json
  ╰─➤ package-lock.json
  ╰─➤ .env.tpl
  ╰─➤ run.Dockerfile
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
╰─➤ .gitignore
╰─➤ Readme.md
```

## Initializing the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd simple-http-server
$ bolt init -n simpleserver
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687868543060'
project_name: simpleserver
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding service-one as a Bolt Service

Now, in order to add service-one as a service in bolt we have executed the following command:

```bash
$ bolt service:add myapp service-one/
Creating app in service-one
Scanning source code
Detected Node.js app
Installed myapp service in service-one
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after adding service-one as a service
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687868543060'
project_name: simpleserver
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services:
  myapp:
    path: service-one
ingress: null
```

```yaml
# This is how service-one/bolt.service.yaml looks
container_name: myapp
stateless: true
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run start
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - service-one:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

## Running the Project

Now, let's run our service using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up
>> Creating Ingress simpleserver...
>> No ingress found in config. Skipping route generation...
$ bolt env:generate
$ bolt env:generate
$ sh -c 'npm install && npm run start'

"myapp" service is up on local platform
```

By default, the configuration in `bolt.yaml` file is to run the project on local machine.

You can now access service-one at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running the Project on Docker

Inorder to run the service in docker when you run `bolt up` command you need to change the `default_service_runner` in `bolt.yaml` file to `docker`.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file should look like if you want to run the service in docker
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687868543060'
project_name: simpleserver
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: docker
services:
  myapp:
    path: service-one
ingress: null
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the service in docker.

## Running the Project on Local

Inorder to run the service in local when you run `bolt up` command you need to change the `default_service_runner` in `bolt.yaml` file to `local`.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file should look like if you want to run the service on local
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687868543060'
project_name: simpleserver
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services:
  myapp:
    path: service-one
ingress: null
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the service on local.

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in your bolt project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Project Runner │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessId ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ myapp        │ up     │ host           │ local          │ NA   │ 13899     ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log myapp
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow myapp
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
>> Stopping todo-app...

"myapp" is down from local platform

>> todo-app is down.
```

## Repo Link

To clone the project you can use [bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/examples/simple-http-server](https://github.com/gluestack/bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/tree/main/examples/simple-http-server)
