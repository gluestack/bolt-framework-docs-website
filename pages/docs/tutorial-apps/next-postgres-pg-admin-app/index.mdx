## Objectives

Here we have created a project where we have three folder named `todo-next`, `postgres` and `pgadmin` which has a next app with postgres and pgadmin as services.

Our Main objectives are:

- Run this project using bolt in local machine.

- Run this project using bolt in docker.

## Project Structure

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
next-postgres-pgadmin/
╰─➤ pgadmin/...
╰─➤ postgres/...
╰─➤ todo-next/...
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.nginx.conf
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
╰─➤ Readme.md
```

## Initialising the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd next-postgres-pgadmin
$ bolt init
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687779995699'
project_name: next-postgres-pgadmin
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding all the services as Bolt service

Now in order to add each and every services we have executed the following commands:

```bash
$ bolt service:add todonext todo-next
Creating app in todo-next
Scanning source code
Detected NextJS app
Installed todonext service in todo-next
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add postgres postgres
Creating app in postgres
Scanning source code
Detected Postgres app
Installed postgres service in postgres
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add pgadmin pgadmin
Creating app in pgadmin
Scanning source code
Detected an Unknown app
Manually edit "bolt.service.yaml", "run.Dockerfile", "build.Dockerfile"
Installed pgadmin service in pgadmin
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after executing the above commands
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687779995699'
project_name: next-postgres-pgadmin
services:
  todonext:
    path: todo-next
  postgres:
    path: postgres
  pgadmin:
    path: pgadmin
ingress: null
```

Each services has their own `bolt.service.yaml` file, here we have configured it as per our requirement.

Also we have configured `run.dockerfile` and `build.dockerfile` for pgadmin and postgres to run them in docker.

## Adding Ingress

We have added ingress configuration for our project inside bolt.yaml file to access our services from outside.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks finally after adding ingress configuration
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687779995699'
project_name: next-postgres-pgadmin
services:
  todonext:
    path: todo-next
  postgres:
    path: postgres
  pgadmin:
    path: pgadmin
ingress:
  - domain: nextjs.local.gluestack.app
    port: 8000
    options:
      - location: /
        rewrite_key: ^/(.*)
        rewrite_value: /$1
        proxy_pass: http://host.docker.internal:3000
  - domain: admin.local.gluestack.app
    port: 8001
    options:
      - location: /
        rewrite_key: ^/(.*)
        rewrite_value: /$1
        proxy_pass: http://host.docker.internal:8080
```

## Running the Project

Now, let's run our services using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up
```

Now this command will first run the services as per their configurations inside `bolt.service.yaml` for each each serivce. After that this will create a nginx configuration file `bolt.nginx.conf` and run the nginx server with the help of this configuration file.

Here `bolt.nginx.conf` file is created from configuration provided in `ingress` in `bolt.yaml` file.

## Running the Project on Docker

Inorder to run the services in docker when you run `bolt up` command you need to change the `default_service_runner` in `bolt.service.yaml` file to `docker`.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.service.yaml file for PGAdmin should look like if you want to run it in docker
container_name: pgadmin
stateless: true
default_service_runner: docker
supported_service_runners:
  - docker
service_runners:
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

```yaml
# This is how bolt.service.yaml file for Postgres should look like if you want to run it in docker
container_name: postgres
stateless: true
default_service_runner: docker
supported_service_runners:
  - docker
service_runners:
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - ./postgres/init.db/:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the services in docker.

## Running the Project on Local

Inorder to run the services in local when you run `bolt up` command you need to change the `default_service_runner` in `bolt.service.yaml` file to `local`.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.service.yaml file for NextJS should look like if you want to run it in local
container_name: todonext
stateless: true
default_service_runner: local
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run dev
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - :/app
      - /app/todo-next/node_modules/
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the services in local.

> **Note:** For services postgres and pgadmin we don't have added any local runner configuration so it will run in docker only, even when your `default_service_runner` is local.

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in this project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Project Runner │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessId ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ todonext     │ up     │ host           │ local          │ NA   │ 27389     ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 2 │ postgres     │ up     │ host           │ docker         │ 5432 │ postgres  ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 3 │ pgadmin      │ up     │ host           │ docker         │ 8080 │ pgadmin   ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log SERVICE_NAME
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow SERVICE_NAME
```

For example, if you want to monitor logs of `todonext` service, you can use the following command:

```bash
# To monitor logs at once
$ bolt log todonext

# To keep monitoring logs in live mode
$ bolt log --follow todonext
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
```

This command will terminate all the services running via bolt in the project.

## Repo Link
