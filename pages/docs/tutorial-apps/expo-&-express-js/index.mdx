## Objectives

Here we have an expo app created using `expo init` and we will be running it using bolt.

Our Main objectives are:

- Run this project using bolt in local machine.

## Project Structure

The project structure of our app is as follows:

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
expo-app/
╰─➤ services/
  ╰─➤ apis/
    ╰─➤ express-generator files...
    ╰─➤ bolt.service.yaml
  ╰─➤ expo/
    ╰─➤ expo-generator files...
    ╰─➤ bolt.service.yaml
╰─➤ .boltignore
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
╰─➤ README.md
```

## Initialising the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd expo-express-apis
$ bolt init
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: expo-express-apis
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding expo app as a Bolt Service

Now, in order to add expo & apis service as a service in bolt we have executed the following command:

```bash
$ bolt service:add expo services/expo
Creating app in service
Scanning source code
Detected Expo app
Installed expo service in ./services/expo
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified

$ bolt service:add apis services/apis
Creating app in service
Scanning source code
Detected Express.js app
Installed apis service in ./services/expo
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after adding all our available services
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: expo-express-apis
services:
  expo:
    path: services/expo
  apis:
    path: services/apis
ingress: null
```

```yaml
# This is how service/bolt.service.yaml looks for expo
container_name: expo
stateless: true
default_service_runner: local
supported_service_runners:
  - local
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run web
```

```yaml
# This is how service/bolt.service.yaml looks for apis
container_name: apis
stateless: true
default_service_runner: vmlocal
supported_service_runners:
  - vmlocal
  - local
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run start
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

## Running the Project

Now, let's run our services using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up

...

"expo" service is up on local platform
"apis" service is up on vmlocal platform
```

By default, the configuration in `bolt.yaml` file is to run the project on local machine.

You can now access:

- expo service at [http://localhost:19006](http://localhost:19006)
- apis service at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Running `bolt up` command make internal checks value defined against `default_service_runner` index in each service's `bolt.service.yaml` file.
Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the expo service on local & apis service on vmlocal.

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in your bolt project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessId ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ apis         │ down   │ NA             │ NA   │ NA        ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 2 │ expo         │ down   │ NA             │ NA   │ NA        ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following commands:

```bash
# For Expo Service
$ bolt log expo
# For APIs Service
$ bolt log apis
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
# For Expo Service
$ bolt log --follow expo
# For Express Service
$ bolt log --follow apis
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
>> Stopping expo...
>> Stopping apis...

...

"expo" is down from local platform
"apis" is down from vmlocal platform
```
