## Objectives

Here we have an expo app created using `expo init` and we will be running it using bolt.

Our Main objectives are:

- Run this project using bolt in local machine.

## Project Structure

The project structure of our app is as follows:

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
expo-app/
╰─➤ expo-files...
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.service.yaml
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
╰─➤ .gitignore
╰─➤ Readme.md
```

## Initialising the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd expo-app
$ bolt init
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: expo-app
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding expo app as a Bolt Service

Now, in order to add service as a service in bolt we have executed the following command:

```bash
$ bolt service:add web .
Creating app in service
Scanning source code
Detected Node.js app
Installed web service in .
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after adding service as a service
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: expo-app
services:
  web:
    path: .
ingress: null
```

```yaml
# This is how service/bolt.service.yaml looks
container_name: web
stateless: true
default_service_runner: local
supported_service_runners:
  - local
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run web
```

## Running the Project

Now, let's run our service using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up
>> Creating Ingress expo-app...
>> No ingress found in config. Skipping route generation...
$ bolt env:generate
$ bolt env:generate
$ sh -c 'npm install && npm run web'

"web" service is up on local platform
```

By default, the configuration in `bolt.yaml` file is to run the project on local machine.

You can now access service at [http://localhost:19006](http://localhost:19006).

## Running the Project on Local

Inorder to run the service in local when you run `bolt up` command you need to change the `default_service_runner` in `bolt.yaml` file to `local`.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.service.yaml file should look like if you want to run the service on local
container_name: todonext
stateless: true
default_service_runner: local
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run dev
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - :/app
      - /app/todo-next/node_modules/
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the service on local.

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in your bolt project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessID ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ web          │ up     │ local          │ NA   │ 13899     ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log web
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow web
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
>> Stopping expo-app...

"web" is down from local platform

>> expo-app is down.
```

## Repo Link

To clone the project you can use [bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/examples/expo-app](https://github.com/gluestack/bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/tree/main/examples/expo-app)
