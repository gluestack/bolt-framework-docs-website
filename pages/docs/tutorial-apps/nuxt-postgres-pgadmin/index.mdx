## Objectives

Here we have created a project where we have three folder named `todo_nuxt`, `postgres` and `pgadmin` which has a nuxt app with postgres and pgadmin as services.

Our Main objectives are:

- Run this project using bolt in local machine.

- Run this project using bolt in docker.

## Project Structure

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
todo_nuxt/
╰─➤ services/
  ╰─➤ pgadmin/...
  ╰─➤ postgres/...
  ╰─➤ todo_nuxt/...
╰─➤ .boltignore
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
```

## Initialising the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd todo_nuxt
$ bolt init
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1690172229386'
project_name: todo_nuxt
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding all the services as Bolt service

Now in order to add each and every services we have executed the following commands:

```bash
$ bolt service:add todonuxt todo_nuxt
Creating app in todo_nuxt
Scanning source code
Detected NuxtJS app
Installed todonuxt service in todo_nuxt
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add postgres postgres
Creating app in postgres
Scanning source code
Detected Postgres app
Installed postgres service in postgres
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add pgadmin pgadmin
Creating app in pgadmin
Scanning source code
Detected an Unknown app
Manually edit "bolt.service.yaml", "run.Dockerfile", "build.Dockerfile"
Installed pgadmin service in pgadmin
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after executing the above commands
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1690172229386'
project_name: todo_nuxt
services:
  pgadmin:
    path: ./services/pgadmin
  todonuxt:
    path: ./services/todo_nuxt
  postgres:
    path: ./services/postgres
ingress: null
```

Each services has their own `bolt.service.yaml` file, here we have configured it as per our requirement.

Also we have configured `run.dockerfile` and `build.dockerfile` for todonuxt, pgadmin and postgres to run them in docker.

## Running the Project

Now, let's run our services using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up

"todonuxt" service is up on docker platform
```

You can now access service at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running the Project on Docker

Inorder to run the todonuxt service in docker when you run `bolt up` command you need to change the `default_service_runner` in `bolt.service.yaml` file to `docker`.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.service.yaml file should look like if you want to run the service in docker
container_name: todonuxt
stateless: true
default_service_runner: docker
depends_on:
  - postgres
service_discovery_offset:
  - 3000
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run dev -- --port ${ASSIGNED_PORT}
    ports:
      - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:${ASSIGNED_PORT}
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:3000
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the service in docker.

Also we have added `depends_on` key in `bolt.service.yaml` so that postgres service will go up first.

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in your bolt project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessId ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ pgadmin      │ up     │ docker         │ 8080 │ pgadmin   ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 2 │ postgres     │ up     │ docker         │ 5432 │ postgres  ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 3 │ todonuxt     │ up     │ docker         │ 3000 │ todonuxt  ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log SERVICE_NAME
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow SERVICE_NAME
```

For example, if you want to monitor logs of `todonuxt` service, you can use the following command:

```bash
# To monitor logs at once
$ bolt log todonuxt

# To keep monitoring logs in live mode
$ bolt log --follow todonuxt
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
```

This command will terminate all the services running via bolt in the project.

## Repo Link

To clone the project you can use [bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/examples/nuxt-postgres-pgadmin](https://github.com/gluestack/bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/tree/main/examples/nuxt-postgres-pgadmin)
