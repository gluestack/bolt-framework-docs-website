## Objectives

- Run this project's Laravel App using Local service runner
- Run this project's MySQL container using Docker service runner

## Project Structure

The project structure of our app is as follows:

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
laravel-auth-mysql/
╰─➤ services
  ╰─➤ laravel
    ╰─➤ ...laravel files
    ╰─➤ bolt.service.yaml
    ╰─➤ build.Dockerfile
    ╰─➤ .env.tpl
    ╰─➤ run.Dockerfile
  ╰─➤ mysql
    ╰─➤ ...mysql files
    ╰─➤ bolt.service.yaml
    ╰─➤ build.Dockerfile
    ╰─➤ .env.tpl
    ╰─➤ run.Dockerfile
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
╰─➤ .gitignore
╰─➤ README.md
```

## Initialising the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd laravel-auth-mysql
$ bolt init
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: "1690972020931"
project_name: laravel-auth-mysql
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding Laravel service as a Bolt Service

To add Laravel service, run the following command -

```bash
$ bolt service:add laravelservice services/laravel
Creating app in service
Scanning source code
Detected Laravel app
Installed laravel service in service
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after adding laravel service
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: "1690972020931"
project_name: laravel-auth-mysql
services:
  laravelservice:
    path: services/laravel
ingress: null
```

```yaml
# This is how services/laravel/bolt.service.yaml looks
container_name: laravelservice
stateless: true
default_service_runner: local
service_discovery_offset:
  - 8000
depends_on:
  - sql
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: composer install && npm install && npm run build && php artisan serve --port ${ASSIGNED_PORT}
    ports:
      - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:${ASSIGNED_PORT}
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:${ASSIGNED_PORT}
```
Also we have added `depends_on` key in `bolt.service.yaml` so that sql service will go up first.

## Adding MySQL service as a Bolt Service

To add MySQL service, run the following command -

```bash
$ bolt service:add sql services/mysql
Creating app in service
Scanning source code
Detected MySQL app
Installed mysql service in service
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after adding sql service
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: "1690972020931"
project_name: laravel-auth-mysql
services:
  laravelservice:
    path: services/laravel
  sql:
    path: services/mysql
ingress: null
vm:
  name: laravelauthmysql
```

```yaml
# This is how services/mysql/bolt.service.yaml looks
# Note that volumes are not configured, we have added it manually to the service
container_name: sql
stateless: true
default_service_runner: docker
service_discovery_offset:
  - 3306
supported_service_runners:
  - docker
service_runners:
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./services/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:3306
```

## Running the Project

Now, let's run the project using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up

"laravelservice" service is up on local platform
"sql" service is up on docker platform
```

You can now access service at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Once you have run the project, you need to run some Laravel specific commands to database migrate, database seed & client app assets bundling.

You can run the following commands to get you started -

```bash
# Goto laravel service directory
$ cd examples/laravel-auth-mysql/services/laravel

# Migrate tables
$ php artisan migrate

# Seed tables
$ php artisan db:seed
```

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in your bolt project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤════════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name   │ Status │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessId ║
╟───┼────────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ laravelservice │ up     │ local          │ 8000 │ 42338     ║
╟───┼────────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 2 │ sql            │ up     │ docker         │ 3306 │ sql       ║
╚═══╧════════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log laravelservice
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow laravelservice
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down

...

"laravelservice" is down from local platform
"sql" is down from docker platform
```

## Repo Link

To clone the project you can use [bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/examples/laravel-auth-mysql](https://github.com/gluestack/bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/tree/main/examples/laravel-auth-mysql)
