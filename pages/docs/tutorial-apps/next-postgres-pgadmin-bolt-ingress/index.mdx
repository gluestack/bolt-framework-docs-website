# Tutorial: Next Postgres PGAdmin BoltIngress

This tutorial is about how to run a Next.js Postgress and PgAdmin in a project using bolt on virtual machine environment and we will also setup Bolt Ingress with our microservices.

## Objectives

Here we have created a project where we have three folder named `todo-next`, `postgres` and `pgadmin` which has a next app with postgres and pgadmin as services.

Our Main objectives are:

- Run this project using bolt in local machine.

- Run this project using bolt in docker.

## Project Structure

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
next-postgres-pgadmin/
╰─➤ pgadmin/...
╰─➤ postgres/...
╰─➤ todo-next/...
╰─➤ .env
╰─➤ .env.tpl
╰─➤ bolt.nginx.conf
╰─➤ bolt.yaml
╰─➤ Readme.md
```

## Initialising the project using Bolt

At first we have initialised the project by running `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ cd next-postgres-pgadmin
$ bolt init
```

It has created a `bolt.yaml` file in our project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687779995699'
project_name: next-postgres-pgadmin
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding all the services as Bolt service

Now in order to add each and every services we have executed the following commands:

```bash
$ bolt service:add todonext todo-next
Creating app in todo-next
Scanning source code
Detected NextJS app
Installed todonext service in todo-next
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add postgres postgres
Creating app in postgres
Scanning source code
Detected Postgres app
Installed postgres service in postgres
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add pgadmin pgadmin
Creating app in pgadmin
Scanning source code
Detected an Unknown app
Manually edit "bolt.service.yaml", "run.Dockerfile", "build.Dockerfile"
Installed pgadmin service in pgadmin
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks after executing the above commands
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687779995699'
project_name: next-postgres-pgadmin
services:
  todonext:
    path: todo-next
  postgres:
    path: postgres
  pgadmin:
    path: pgadmin
ingress: null
```

Each services has their own `bolt.service.yaml` file, here we have configured it as per our requirement.

We have configured `run.dockerfile` and `build.dockerfile` for **PGAdmin** and **Postgres** to run them in VM's Docker. And **Next app** to run on VM's Local.

## Adding Ingress

We have added ingress configuration for our project inside `bolt.yaml` file to access our services from outside.

```yaml
# This is how bolt.yaml file looks finally after adding ingress configuration
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687779995699'
project_name: next-postgres-pgadmin
services:
  todonext:
    path: todo-next
  postgres:
    path: postgres
  pgadmin:
    path: pgadmin
ingress:
  - domain: nextjs.local.gluestack.app
    port: 8000
    options:
      - location: /
        rewrite_key: ^/(.*)
        rewrite_value: /$1
        proxy_pass: http://host.docker.internal:3000
  - domain: admin.local.gluestack.app
    port: 8001
    options:
      - location: /
        rewrite_key: ^/(.*)
        rewrite_value: /$1
        proxy_pass: http://host.docker.internal:8080
```

## Running the Project

Now, let's run our services using Bolt.

```bash
# The following command will run the service as per the configuration in bolt.yaml file
$ bolt up
```

Now this command will first run the services as per their configurations inside `bolt.service.yaml` for each each serivce. After that, bolt will create a nginx configuration file named as `bolt.nginx.conf` in your project's root directory and run the **Nginx server** on your host machine's **Docker**.

## Running the Project on Virtual Machine

Below's our `bolt.service.yaml` files for all three services configured to run on virtual machine for your reference.

```yaml
# This is bolt.service.yaml file for PGAdmin
container_name: pgadmin
stateless: true
default_service_runner: vmdocker
supported_service_runners:
  - docker
  - vmdocker
service_runners:
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

```yaml
# This is bolt.service.yaml file for Postgres
container_name: postgres
stateless: true
default_service_runner: vmdocker
supported_service_runners:
  - docker
  - vmdocker
service_runners:
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - ./postgres/init.db/:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
```

```yaml
# This is bolt.service.yaml file for Todo Next App
container_name: todonext
stateless: true
default_service_runner: vmlocal
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
  - vmlocal
  - vmdocker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run dev
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - :/app
      - /app/todo-next/node_modules/
```

Now if you run `bolt up` command it will run the services in virtual machine's environment.

## Running the Project on Host Machine

Now since we have configured our **default_service_runner** as either **vmlocal** or **vmdocker** but you would like to run them on your host machine, you don't need to reconfigure your services' **bolt.service.yaml** files.

You can do that by just running the following command from project's root directory -

```bash
$ bolt up --host
```

## Listing Bolt Services

You can also see the list of services in this project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessID ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ todonext     │ up     │ vmlocal        │ 3000 │ NA        ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 2 │ pgadmin      │ up     │ vmdocker       │ 8080 │ NA        ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 3 │ postgres     │ up     │ vmdocker       │ 5432 │ NA        ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log SERVICE_NAME
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow SERVICE_NAME
```

For example, if you want to monitor logs of `todonext` service, you can use the following command:

```bash
# To monitor logs at once
$ bolt log todonext

# To keep monitoring logs in live mode
$ bolt log --follow todonext
```

## Stopping Your Project

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
```

This command will terminate all the services running via bolt in the project.

## Repo Link

To clone the project you can use [bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/examples/next-postgres-pgadmin](https://github.com/gluestack/bolt-framework-tutorial-apps/tree/main/examples/next-postgres-pgadmin)
