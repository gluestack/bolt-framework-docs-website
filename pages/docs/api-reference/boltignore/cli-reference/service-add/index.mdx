## Service Auto Detection

This command is designed with auto detection enabled, providing the convenience of automatically generating a preconfigured bolt.service.yaml file for the service. This pre-filled file contains the essential content related to the service, eliminating the need to manually configure it from scratch.

While the generated content can be modified according to your specific configuration requirements, this feature significantly expedites the process of adding a service. By eliminating the need to worry about initial configuration details, you can swiftly incorporate new services into your project.

This streamlined approach enhances efficiency and reduces the potential for configuration errors, enabling you to quickly integrate services without compromising on customization options.
