# Definig Bolt Service file

Bolt CLI manages your projects and its services using two types of yaml files. One of them is **bolt.service.yaml**. Here's how **bolt.service.yaml** work and manages processes for you.

## bolt.service.yaml

This file contains your service's information like container name, service-runners platform it can run on. And each service-runner object contains envfile path and build command.
Here's how a sample bolt service file looks like —

```yaml
container_name: <your container name>
stateless: <true | false>
service-runners:
  local:
    envfile: <path/to/envfile>
    build: <your project's run command>
  docker:
    envfile: <path/to/envfile>
    build: <path/to/your/Dockerfile>
    ports:
      - <your host machine's port>:<your project's running port in docker>
```

Here's how **bolt.service.yaml** file would look after running the service:add command —

```yaml
container_name: myapp
stateless: true
service-runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm start
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```
