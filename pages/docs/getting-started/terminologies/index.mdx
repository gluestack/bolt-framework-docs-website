## Bolt CLI

Bolt CLI is a command-line interface tool that provides a comprehensive set of commands, arguments, and options for efficient management, execution and monitoring of services and projects. It offers a convenient way to interact with Bolt and perform various operations.

## Bolt Project

A Bolt Project represents a fully functional application capable of running on any system. It encompasses a wide range of possibilities, including applications developed using popular frameworks and technologies such as NextJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, Laravel PHP, or Golang.
Additionally, it can also encompass a monorepo containing multiple microservices, providing a flexible and scalable architecture for complex projects.

## Bolt Project Runner

Bolt Project Runner is a powerful utility designed to facilitate the management of multiple projects. It enables the execution of projects either on the host machine or within a virtual machine environment.

The host machine refers to the user's local computer or server, while the virtual machine is an internal virtualisation platform implemented using Alpine Linux v3.18.

### Bolt Project Runner Options

- Host
- VM

## Bolt Service

A Bolt Service refers to a self-contained and fully functional application or microservice. Within a Bolt Project, multiple services can be included, each serving a specific purpose or functionality.

A Bolt Service can be a Process on the host machine, a Docker Container or a Process on the Virtual Machine.

## Bolt Service Runner

Bolt Service Runner is a component within the Bolt framework that facilitates the management of various services defined within a Bolt Project.

Service Runner enables users to run their projects either locally on their system or within a Docker environment. This runner provides a seamless execution environment for services, allowing for efficient development and testing of applications and microservices.

### Bolt Service Runner Options

- Local
- Docker
