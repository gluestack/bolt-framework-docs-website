## Adding Bolt to a Project

Go inside the project which you want to run via bolt, run `bolt init` command to create `bolt.yaml` file inside your project.

```bash
$ cd PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT
$ bolt init
```

This will create a `bolt.yaml` file in your project's root directory.

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services: null
ingress: null
```

Let's take the below project example,

```bash
# Below's the directory structure of our project.
bolt-project/
╰─➤ service-one/
  ╰─➤ index.js
  ╰─➤ package.json
╰─➤ service-two/
  ╰─➤ index.js
  ╰─➤ package.json
```

Now if I do `bolt init` inside `bolt-project` directory, it will create a `bolt.yaml` file at root of the project which is something like this:

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: bolt-project
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services: null
ingress: null
```

## Adding a Project Service as Bolt Service

In order to add a service to your project, you can use the `bolt service:add` command. This command will create a `bolt.service.yaml` file inside your service directory and will include the same in your `bolt.yaml` file.

```bash
$ bolt service:add SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME SERVICE_PATH
```

Now, let's add service-one and service-two with its instance name as servicetwo and servicetwo respectively to the `bolt.yaml` file by running the following commands:

```bash
$ bolt service:add serviceone service-one/
Creating app in service-one
Scanning source code
Detected Node.js app
Installed serviceone service in service-one
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

```bash
$ bolt service:add servicetwo service-two/
Creating app in service-one
Scanning source code
Detected Node.js app
Installed serviceone service in service-one
Verifying metadata for other services..
Metadata verified
```

Bolt `service:add` command runs and automatically detects the type of service you are using and creates a `bolt.service.yaml` template init & includes the same into your `bolt.yaml` file.

```yaml
# This is how your bolt.yaml file looks
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1687780932260'
project_name: boltproject
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services:
  serviceone:
    path: service-one/
  servicetwo:
    path: service-two/
ingress: null
```

```yaml
# This is how your service-one/bolt.service.yaml looks
container_name: serviceone
stateless: true
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && node app.js
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 9000:9000
    volumes:
      - service-one:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

```yaml
# This is how your service-two/bolt.service.yaml looks
container_name: servicetwo
stateless: true
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && node app.js
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 9000:9000
    volumes:
      - service-one:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

**Note:** Configure these files as per your need.

## Running Project via Bolt

In order to run the project using bolt you need to run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt up
```

Now, if we run services shown in example above using Bolt.

```bash
$ bolt up
>> Creating Ingress bolt-project...
>> No ingress found in config. Skipping route generation...
$ bolt env:generate
$ bolt env:generate
$ bolt env:generate
$ sh -c 'npm install && npm run dev'
$ sh -c 'npm install && npm run dev'

"serviceone" service is up on local platform


"servicetwo" service is up on local platform
```

You can now access these services at the port mentioned in their logic.

## Listing Services From Project

You can also the list of services in your bolt project and their statuses using the `service:list` command.

```bash
$ bolt service:list
```

If we run the above command for our example project, we will get the following output something like this:

```bash
$ bolt service:list
╔═══╤══════════════╤════════╤════════════════╤════════════════╤══════╤═══════════╗
║ # │ Service Name │ Status │ Project Runner │ Service Runner │ Port │ ProcessId ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 1 │ serviceone   │ up     │ host           │ local          │ NA   │ 6220      ║
╟───┼──────────────┼────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────┼───────────╢
║ 2 │ servicetwo   │ up     │ host           │ local          │ NA   │ 6221      ║
╚═══╧══════════════╧════════╧════════════════╧════════════════╧══════╧═══════════╝
```

## Monitoring Service Logs

To monitor logs, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log SERVICE_NAME
```

To keep monitoring logs in live mode, use the following command:

```bash
$ bolt log --follow SERVICE_NAME
```

## Stopping Project via bolt

To stop your project, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ bolt down
```

If we run the above command for our example project, we will get the following output something like this:

```bash
$ bolt down
>> Stopping bolt-project...

"servicetwo" is down from local platform


"serviceone" is down from local platform

>> bolt-project is down.
```
