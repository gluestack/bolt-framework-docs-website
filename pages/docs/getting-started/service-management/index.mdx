# ENV Management

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `env:generate` command and its usage within a project that consists of multiple microservices. The command allows you to generate `.env` files based on `.env.tpl` templates, enabling the management of environment variables in a structured manner.

## Project Structure

In this project setup, we have a root directory representing the project itself, which contains multiple microservice directories. Each microservice directory has its own `.env.tpl` file that defines environment variables specific to that microservice. The root directory also contains a `.env.tpl` file, which defines project-wide variables applicable to the entire project.

The project structure looks as follows:

```
project-a/
  .env.tpl (project-wide variables)
  service-a/
    .env.tpl (variables specific to service-a)
  service-b/
    .env.tpl (variables specific to service-b)
```

## env:generate Command

The `env:generate` command scans the project structure based on `bolt.yaml` & `bolt.service.yaml` files' `envfile` variables, identifies `.env.tpl` files, and generates corresponding `.env` files for each microservice. It also exports microservice-specific variables to the root variable, allowing inter-microservice variable referencing.

### Generating `.env` Files

When executing the `env:generate` command, it performs the following actions:

1. Scans the project structure based on `bolt.yaml` & `bolt.service.yaml` files and identifies `.env.tpl` files within each microservice directory.
2. For each `.env.tpl` file found, generates a corresponding `.env` file in the same directory.
3. Populates the generated `.env` file with variables and their respective values as defined in the `.env.tpl` file.

### Microservice Variable Export

The `env:generate` command exports microservice-specific variables to the root variable, allowing easy referencing among microservices. The exported variables follow the format: `%<service_name_without_special_chars>_<variable_name>%`.

For example, if there is a variable named `my_var` in `service-a`, it would be exported as `SERVICEA_MY_VAR` in the root variable. This enables other microservices to reference `SERVICEA_MY_VAR` to access the value of `my_var` from `service-a`.

### Root `.env.tpl` File

The root directory of the project contains a `.env.tpl` file that defines project-wide variables applicable to the entire project. Variables defined in this file are not prefixed with a service name since they are not specific to any particular microservice.

## Usage Example

To illustrate the usage of the `env:generate` command and variable referencing, let's consider a scenario:

Assume the following variables are defined in the respective `.env.tpl` files:

**project-a/.env.tpl:**

```
PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**project-a/service-a/.env.tpl:**

```
SERVICEA_HOST=localhost
SERVICEA_PORT=8080
```

**project-a/service-b/.env.tpl:**

```
SERVICEB_API_KEY=12345
SERVICEB_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

When executing the `env:generate` command, the following files will be generated:

**project-a/.env:**

```
PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**project-a/service-a/.env:**

```
SERVICEA_HOST=localhost
SERVICEA_PORT=8080
```

**project-a/service-b/.env:**

```
SERVICEB_API_KEY=12345
SERVICEB_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Additionally, the root variable will contain the following exported variables:

```
SERVICEA_HOST=localhost
SERVICEA_PORT=8080
SERVICEB_API_KEY=12345
SERVICEB_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Microservices can now reference these variables using the `%service_name_variable_name%` syntax. For example, in `service-a`, you can use `%SERVICEB_API_KEY%` to access the value of `SERVICEB_API_KEY` defined in `service-b`.

## Summary

The `env:generate` command simplifies the management of environment variables in a project with multiple microservices. By using `.env.tpl` files, you can define variables specific to each microservice and a project-wide `.env.tpl` file for variables applicable to the entire project. The command generates `.env` files for each microservice and exports microservice-specific variables to the root variable, allowing for easy referencing among microservices.

By following this approach, you can maintain a structured and consistent environment variable management system for your project.

## Conclusion

This document provided an overview of the `env:generate` command and its usage in a project with multiple microservices. It explained the project structure, the generation of `.env` files, the export of microservice-specific variables to the root variable, and demonstrated an example scenario.

By leveraging the `env:generate` command and adhering to the recommended project structure, you can effectively manage environment variables in your multi-microservice projects.
