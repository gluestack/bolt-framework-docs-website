# Introduction

**Development without the pain!**

Bolt is a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) tool designed to simplify the management and deployment of projects and services. It provides a comprehensive set of commands and options to streamline various aspects of the development lifecycle, from project initialisation to service deployment and monitoring.

With Bolt, developers can easily configure and manage services through a centralised configuration file called `bolt.yaml`. This file allows defining the services required for a project, specifying their dependencies, and configuring various settings such as ports, volumes, and environment variables. The framework provides commands to add, start, stop, and list services, making it effortless to orchestrate and maintain complex service architectures.

In addition to service management, Bolt offers features for handling routing and ingress configuration. It includes commands to generate an Nginx configuration file (bolt.nginx.conf) based on the bolt.yaml ingress configuration. This feature simplifies the setup of routing rules and enables developers to easily manage incoming traffic and define routes for different services within their projects.

Bolt also provides functionalities for generating environment files. By leveraging a template file (.env.tpl), developers can generate .env files for all services, automatically populating them with the necessary environment variables. This streamlines the process of configuring environment-specific settings and ensures consistency across different environments.

When it comes to deployment, Bolt offers a straightforward approach. It allows developers to prepare the project by compressing the required files and dependencies. The framework includes deployment commands that initiate the deployment process, making it easier to package and distribute the project to various hosting platforms or deployment targets.

Furthermore, Bolt includes commands for monitoring and inspecting services. Developers can retrieve logs for specific services using the log command or get a comprehensive overview of service activity using the `exec` command. These features assist in troubleshooting, debugging, and monitoring the behaviour of individual services within the project.

Overall, Bolt is a versatile CLI tool that simplifies the management, deployment, and monitoring of projects and their services. By providing a unified interface and a rich set of commands, it enables developers to focus on building and delivering their applications while abstracting away the complexities of service orchestration and deployment.
