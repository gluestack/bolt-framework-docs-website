# Defining a Bolt Project

Bolt CLI manages your projects and its services using two types of yaml files. One is of them is **bolt.yaml**. Here’s how **bolt.yaml** work and manages processes for you.

## bolt.yaml

This file contains your project information, envfile’s path, default service runner for your project, bolt services list, ingress routing to your bolt services & project runner server’s configuration.
You can generate this file using init & service:add commands. Below’s the base template for **bolt.yaml** file.

```yaml
envfile: <path/to/envfile>
project_id: "<Project ID>"
project_name: <Project Name>
default_project_runner: <host | vm>
default_service_runner: <local | docker>
services: {}
ingress: null
```

Here’s how **bolt.yaml** file would look after running the init command —

```yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: "1687504622045"
project_name: mynextapp
default_project_runner: host
default_service_runner: local
services: null
ingress: null
```
