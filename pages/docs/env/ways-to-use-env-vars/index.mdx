# Ways to use ENV variables

In this section, we'll explain how to use environment variables from the `.env.tpl` file in both `bolt.yaml` and `bolt.service.yaml` files.

Bolt keeps `.env.tpl` file in your project's root and against each of your bolt services. This is because, you can use environment variables in your `bolt.service.yaml` files and `bolt.yaml`'s `ingress` attribute.

We'll cover two main aspects:

- **Using Environment Variables in bolt.yaml for bolt Ingress Attributes**
- **Using Environment Variables in bolt.service.yaml for bolt Service Configuration**

## Using Environment Variables in bolt.yaml for Ingress Attributes

The `bolt.yaml` file contains configuration for your project, services and ingress. In the ingress section, you can define domain-specific routes to forward incoming requests to the appropriate service. To make these configurations more dynamic and configurable, you can use environment variables from the `.env.tpl` file. Here's how:

### Defining Environment Variables in .env.tpl

In your project's root directory, you have a file named `.env.tpl`. This file serves as a template for defining environment variables that can be used in other configuration files. For the ingress attribute in `bolt.yaml`, you can define the environment variables like this:

```plaintext
# .env.tpl
TODOONE_APP_PORT=8001
TODOTWO_APP_PORT=8002
```

### Using Environment Variables in bolt.yaml

In `bolt.yaml`, you have defined ingress configurations for two domains (`todo-one.local.gluestack.app` and `todo-two.local.gluestack.app`). You can use the previously defined environment variables for the `proxy_pass` attribute like this:

```yaml
# bolt.yaml
envfile: .env.tpl
project_id: '1689657879944'
project_name: two-next-apps
services:
  todoone:
    path: ./services/todo-one
  todotwo:
    path: ./services/todo-two
ingress:
  - domain: todo-one.local.gluestack.app
    port: ${TODOONE_APP_PORT} # Use the environment variable here
    options:
      - location: /
        rewrite_key: ^/(.*)
        rewrite_value: /$1
        proxy_pass: http://localhost:${TODOONE_APP_PORT} # Use the environment variable here
  - domain: todo-two.local.gluestack.app
    port: ${TODOTWO_APP_PORT} # Use the environment variable here
    options:
      - location: /
        rewrite_key: ^/(.*)
        rewrite_value: /$1
        proxy_pass: http://localhost:${TODOTWO_APP_PORT} # Use the environment variable here
```

By using `${SERVICENAME_VARIABLENAME}`, the values for `port` and `proxy_pass` attributes will be dynamically replaced with the values from the `.env.tpl` file. This allows you to change these values easily without modifying the `bolt.yaml` file directly.

## Using Environment Variables in bolt.service.yaml for Service Configuration

Each service in your project has its own `bolt.service.yaml` file, which contains configuration details specific to that service. You can also use environment variables from `.env.tpl` in these service-specific configuration files.

### Defining Service-Specific Environment Variables in .env.tpl

In the `.env.tpl` file, you can also define environment variables specific to each service. For example:

#### For `todo-one`:

```plaintext
# services/todo-one/.env.tpl
APP_PORT=4001
LOCAL_BUILD_COMMAND="npm run dev"
DOCKER_BUILD_FILEPATH=./run.Dockerfile
```

#### For `todo-two`:

```plaintext
# services/todo-two/.env.tpl
APP_PORT=4002
LOCAL_BUILD_COMMAND="npm run dev"
DOCKER_BUILD_FILEPATH=./run.Dockerfile
```

### Using Environment Variables in bolt.service.yaml

In the `bolt.service.yaml` files for `todo-one` and `todo-two` services, you can use the environment variables as follows:

#### For `todo-one`:

```yaml
# services/todo-one/bolt.service.yaml
container_name: todoone
stateless: true
default_service_runner: docker
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: npm install && npm run dev
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:4001
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ./run.Dockerfile
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:4001
    volumes:
      - ./services/todo-one:/app/todo-one
      - /app/todo-one/node_modules
```

#### For `todo-two`:

```yaml
# services/todo-two/bolt.service.yaml
container_name: todotwo
stateless: true
default_service_runner: docker
supported_service_runners:
  - local
  - docker
service_runners:
  local:
    envfile: .env
    build: ${LOCAL_BUILD_COMMAND} # Use the environment variable here
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:4002
  docker:
    envfile: .env
    build: ${DOCKER_BUILD_FILEPATH} # Use the environment variable here
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:4002
    volumes:
      - ./services/todo-two:/app/todo-two
      - /app/todo-two/node_modules
```

By using `${VARIABLE_NAME}`, the values for `build` and other attributes will be dynamically replaced with the values from the `.env.tpl` file specific to each service. This makes your service configurations more flexible and allows you to customize each service separately.

In summary, using environment variables from the `.env.tpl` file in your `bolt.yaml` and `bolt.service.yaml` files allows you to keep your configurations separate from your code and makes it easier to manage different environments and settings for your project and services.

We have put down a tutorial to help you get started and give you a basic example of how env management really works and how to use it in a project containing two services (ie. NextJS apps) using Bolt!
