# Assigned Host and Assigned Ports

In this section, we'll cover how does Bolt manages the `host` and `ports` for your services and maintains them throughout the project.

Bolt keeps `.env.tpl` file in your project's root and against each of your bolt services. This is because, you can use environment variables in your `bolt.service.yaml` files and `bolt.yaml`'s `ingress` attribute.

We'll cover two main aspects:

- **How does Bolt assign host to your services**
- **How does Bolt assign ports to your services**

## How does Bolt assign host to your services

Bolt assigns a host to your services in the following way:

- Whenever Bolt runs a service, it automatically inserts the key name ASSIGNED_HOST with the default host value of localhost into the .env.tpl file of that service.

  For example suppose you have a service named `nextapp`, and you run it using `bolt service:up postgres -sr local`, or `bolt up` then Bolt will automatically insert the following line into the .env.tpl file of the `nextapp` service:

  ```bash
  ASSIGNED_HOST=localhost
  ```

- Now in order to access host variable in `.env.tpl` of one service say `postgres` to another service say `nextapp`, you can use the following syntax in .env.tpl file of `nextapp`:

  ```bash
  PGHOST=%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_HOST%
  ```

  Here `%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_HOST%` will automatically gets replaced in .env file of the `nextapp` as per following rules:

  - If `nextapp` is running on `local or vmlocal` then `%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_HOST%` will be replaced with `localhost`.
  - If `nextapp` is running on `docker or vmdocker` then `%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_HOST%`  will be replaced with `host.docker.internal` if your operating system is `macOS` or `windows` otherwise it will be replaced with `localhost`.

  So overall result will be something like this:

  ```bash
  # If service1 is running on local or vmlocal
  POSTGRESHOST=localhost

  # OR

  # If service1 is running on docker or vmdocker and current OS is macOS or windows
  POSTGRESHOST=host.docker.internal

  # OR

  # If service1 is running on docker or vmdocker and current OS is any other platform
  POSTGRESHOST=localhost
  ```

> **Note:** You can use `${SERVICE_NAME_ASSIGNED_HOST}` in your bolt.yaml file for ingress attributes like proxy_pass for defining hosts.

## How does Bolt assign ports to your services

Whenever we add a service using bolt, bolt inserts a key in `bolt.service.yaml` file named `service_discovery_offset`. This key is used to assign ports to your services.

Bolt assigns ports to your services in the following way:

- At first bolt picks up the first port from `service_discovery_offset` and checks if it is already in use or not. If it is already in use then bolt will increment the port value by 1 and will retry the same process upto 5 times until it finds a port which is not in use otherwise it will stop the process and will throw an error.

- Once it gets a port to run the service it will insert the key named `ASSIGNED_PORT` with the port value into the .env.tpl file of that service.

  For example suppose you have a service named `postgres` and assume this is how its `bolt.service.yaml` files looks like:

  ```yaml
  container_name: postgres
  stateless: true
  default_service_runner: docker
  service_discovery_offset:
    - 5432
  supported_service_runners:
    - docker
  service_runners:
    docker:
      envfile: .env
      build: ./run.Dockerfile
      ports:
        - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:5432
      volumes:
        - ./services/postgres/init.db/:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
  ```

  You can run it using `bolt service:up postgres -sr local`, or `bolt up` then Bolt will look for the free ports starting from `5432` and whatever port it will find free it will automatically insert that port's value into the .env.tpl file of the `postgres` service like this:

  ```bash
  # Here I am assuming that bolt found port 5432 is free to run the postgres service
  ASSIGNED_PORT=5432
  ```
  Now this port will be used to expose the `postgres` service from docker to your system.

- If a particular service requires more than one port to run, then you can add those ports in `service_discovery_offset` key in bolt.yaml file, for example `minio` requires two ports to run, first one is to run minio and second one is to run minio console, so its `bolt.service.yaml` file looks like this:

  ```yaml
  container_name: minio
  stateless: true
  default_service_runner: docker
  service_discovery_offset:
    - 9000
    - 9001
  supported_service_runners:
    - docker
  service_runners:
    docker:
      envfile: .env
      build: ./run.Dockerfile
      ports:
        - ${ASSIGNED_PORT}:9000
        - ${ASSIGNED_PORT_1}:9001
      volumes:
        - ./services/minio/data/:/data/
  ```

  Now when you run this service using `bolt service:up minio -sr docker`, or `bolt up` then Bolt will look for the free ports starting from `9000` and `9001` and whatever ports it will find free it will automatically insert those ports' values into the .env.tpl file of the `minio` service like this:

  ```bash
  # Here I am assuming that bolt found port 9000 and 9001 are free to run the minio service
  ASSIGNED_PORT=9000
  ASSIGNED_PORT_1=9001
  ```

  Now these ports will be used to expose the `minio` service from docker to your system.

- Now in order to access port variable in `.env` of one service say `postgres` to another service say `nextapp`, you can use the following syntax in .env.tpl file of `nextapp`:

  ```bash
  PGPORT=%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_PORT%
  ```

  Here `%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_PORT%` will automatically gets replaced by the actual value of `POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_PORT`.

  So if `postgres` service's assigned port is 5432 then `%POSTGRES_ASSIGNED_PORT%` will be replaced with 5432, so actual value in .env file will be something like this:

  ```bash
  PGPORT=5432
  ```

> **Note:** You can use `${SERVICE_NAME_ASSIGNED_PORT}` in your bolt.yaml file for ingress attributes like proxy_pass for defining ports.
